/*! \brief Generate a graph of accessible space from a given start point. 
	
	\details
	The Graph Generator maps out "accessible" space on a model from a given starting point. In graphs created
	by this algorithm, node represents a point in space that a human can occupy, and each edge between nodes
	indicates that a human can traverse from one node to another node. The Graph Generator is a powerful tool
	for analyzing space, since the graph or nodes it outputs can be used as input to all the analysis methods
	offered by DHARTAPI, allowing for it to be the starting point of other analysis methods within
	DHARTAPI.

	\par Obstacle Support
	The Graph Generator supports marking specific geometry as walkable or obstacles. Obstacle surfaces  are surfaces
	that the graph generator is not allowed to generate nodes on, while walkable surfaces are the only surfaces that the
	graph generator is permitted to generate nodes on. Depending on what arguments are first passed to the graph generator,
	it will use different rules for determining which of the inputs are obstacles and which are not. When no geometry
	ids are specified, all geometry is considered walkable. When only obstacle surfaces are specified, all geometry
	other than that in the obstacles array are considered walkable. If both an obstacle and walkable array are specified
	then obstacles will be considered inaccessible, walkable surfaces will be accessible, and all geometry not in
	either array will be considered not traversable.

	\note
	All arguments are in meters for distances and degrees for angles
	unless otherwise specified. For all calculations, the Graph Generator assumes
	geometry is Z-Up i.e. upstep is how high the step is in the z-direction, ground
	checks are performed in the -z direction etc.

	\see GraphGenerator for more details.

		An edge is considered valid if:
		1) Both parent and child the potential child are over valid walkable ground
		2) After the child is moved to be directly on top of the ground it is over
		   The slope between parent and child is within upslope/downslope limits OR

				 moved downwards to ensure it's over valid ground.
