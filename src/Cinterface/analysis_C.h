	\brief		Construct a graph by performing a breadth-first search of accessible space

	\param		ray_tracer				Raytracer containing the geometry to use for graph generation. 

	\param		start_point				The starting point for the graph generator to begin searching from. 
										If this isn't above solid ground, no nodes will be generated.

	\param		spacing					Space between nodes for each step of the search. 
										Lower values will yield more nodes for a higher resolution graph.

	\param		MaxNodes				Stop generation after this many nodes.
										A value of -1 will generate an infinite amount of nodes. 
										Note that the final node count may be greater than this value.

	\param		UpStep					Maximum height of a step the graph can traverse. 
										Any steps higher this will be considered inaccessible.

	\param		UpSlope					Maximum upward slope the graph can traverse in degrees. 
										Any slopes steeper than this will be considered inaccessible.

	\param		DownStep				Maximum step down the graph can traverse. 
										Any steps steeper than this will be considered inaccessible.

	\param		DownSlope				The maximum downward slope the graph can traverse. 
										Any slopes steeper than this will be considered inaccessible.

	\param		max_step_connection		Multiplier for number of children to generate for each node. 
										Increasing this value will increase the number of edges in the graph, 
										and as a result the amount of memory the algorithm requires.
			
	\param		min_connections			The required out-degree for a node to be valid and stored.
										This must be greater than 0 and equal or less than the total connections created from max_step_connections.
										Default is 1. A value of 8 when max_step_connections=1 would be a grid.

	\param		core_count				Number of cores to use. -1 will use all available cores, 
										and 0 or 1 will run a serialized version of the algorithm.

	\param		out_graph				Address of a (\link HF::SpatialStructures::Graph \endlink *);
										*out_graph will address heap-allocated memory to an initialized 
										\link HF::SpatialStructures::Graph \endlink on success.

	\returns	\link HF_STATUS::OK \endlink if graph creation was successful.
				\link HF_STATUS::NO_GRAPH \endlink if \link GenerateGraph \endlink failed to generate a graph with more than a single node.

	You must <b>load an .obj file</b> and <b>create a BVH</b> first.<br>
