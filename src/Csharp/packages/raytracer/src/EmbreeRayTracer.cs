/*!
    \brief Cast rays to determine if and where they intersect geometry.

    \details
    The basics of raytracing entail casting a ray from an origin point in a
    specific direction and determining whether or not it intersects with a
    set of geometry. Certain functions can even determine where the intersection
    occured. Generally, every RayTracer will contain a set of geometry and provide
    functions for casting rays from an origin point in a specific direciton. Some
    generate an accelerated structure from geometry called a Bounding Volume
    Hierarchy, or BVH. A BVH can drastically decrease the time it takes to
    calculate ray intersections, but can be more complicated to manage compared
    to standard buffers of geometry.


    \see EmbreeRaytracer for an implementation of a raytracer using Intel's Embree Library as a backend.

        \brief Cast rays with Intel's Embree raytracing library.

        \remarks
        All functions in this class first require the creation of an EmbreeBVH with valid mesh geometry.

        \see Geometry.MeshInfo for details on converting a mesh to a format that DHARTAPI can interpret
        \see EmbreeBVH for details on generating a BVH from geometry.
