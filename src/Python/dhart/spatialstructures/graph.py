class Graph:
    """ A graph representing connections between points in space.

    Every Node in the graph contains a set of  X,Y,Z coordinates which can be
    used to represent a specific point in space. This graph internally is 
    stored as a Sparse Matrix for space efficency. Nodes are stored in a 
    hashmap containing X,Y, and Z coordinates, allowing for quick indexing
    of specific nodes by location alone. Access to this graph's internal
    CSR is available through Graph.CompressToCSR().

    Cost Types:
        This Graph is capable of holding multiple cost types for any of it's 
        edges. Each cost type has a distinct key as it's name, such as 
        "CrossSlope" or "EnergyExpenditure". Upon creation, the graph is 
        assigned a default cost type, Distance which can be accessed explicitly 
        by the key "Distance" or leaving the cost_type field blank. Alternate 
        costs have corresponding edges in the default cost set, but different 
        costs to traverse from the parent to the child node.

    Node Attributes:
        The graph is able to store an arbitrary amount of information about the 
        nodes it contains as strings. Similar to alternate cost types, node 
        attributes are each have a distinct key as their name, but instead of 
        conatining information about edges in the graph, node attributes contain 
        information about nodes. Unlike the cost algorithms in edgecosts, right 
        now there is no functionality within DHARTAPI that populates the
        node attributes of the graph with any kind of metric, however the 
        methods to add and clear node attributes are made available so you are 
        free to add your own node attributes.
