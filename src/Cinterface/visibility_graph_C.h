	\param		nodes		Coordinates of nodes to use in generating the visibility graph.
							Every three floats (every three members in nodes)

	\param		num_nodes	Amount of nodes (points) that will be used to generate the visibility graph.
							This should be equal to (size of nodes / 3), 
							since every three floats represents a single point.

	\param		out_graph	Address of (\link HF::SpatialStructures::Graph \endlink *); address of a pointer to a \link HF::SpatialStructures::Graph \endlink.
							*(out_graph) will point to memory allocated by \link CreateVisibilityGraphAllToAll \endlink.

	\param		height		How far to offset nodes from the ground.

	\returns	HF_STATUS::OK on completion

	\see		\ref raytracer_setup (How to create a BVH), \ref raytracer_teardown (How to destroy a BVH)

	Begin by <b>loading an .obj file</b> (\ref mesh_setup).<br>
	Then, <b>create a BVH</b> (\ref raytracer_setup) using the <b>mesh</b>.<br>

	Set up the parameters for the visibility graph.

	Very important: <b>after generating/adding edges to a graph -- it must be compressed.</b>
	\snippet	tests\src\visibility_graph_cinterface.cpp snippet_VisibilityGraph_CreateVisibilityGraphAllToAll_compress

	You are now ready to use the visibility graph. Start by retrieving the <b>CSR representation</b> of the graph:<br>

	Set up the <b>pointers</b> required to iterate over the CSR. Then <b>output the CSR to the console</b>:<br>
	\snippet	tests\src\visibility_graph_cinterface.cpp snippet_VisibilityGraph_CreateVisibilityGraphAllToAll_output_1

	After use, the visibility graph resources must be <b>relinquished</b>:
