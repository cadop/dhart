# Overview

Welcome to DHART:a C++ package with interfaces to Python, C, and C# for  Design, Humans, Analysis, and RoboTics.

There are a few components to the package, but the main focus is in providing fast ray-casting interfaces for python and C# for a variety of analysis and evaluation techniques.  Generally, you should be able to build a grid-like structure of the floors for a 3D model, calculate shortest paths by distance/visibility/energy and custom metrics, and use these tools inside of a variety of programs such as Unity, Rhino, and more. 

We have extensive documentation on the API, and welcome new contributions and bug fixes. Please make sure to take a look at the contributing guide.

### Limitations

- Currently it is available on Windows OS, and some work has been done to port it to Linux.
- Integration with Rhino is currently limited to viewing analysis results through `json` files. 

### Coming Soon

- Rhino and Grasshopper Plugin
- Additional documentation for how to simulate LIDAR in python
- Dedicated Releases for each language
- Revit Plugin

## Features

- Python, C, C#, C++ interface
- Extract connected grid-based graphs from 3d models
- Calculate shortest path based on Distance, Energy, Visibility, and others
- Graph parsing traverses stairs and slopes
- Easily generate visibility graphs and analyze locations of environment
- Calculate view scores, percentage of view, and points of interest
- Uses Embree raytracer for fast raycasting
- Has switchable backend to use nanoRT for raycasting with double precision
- Demos and instructions for integrating with Rhino 3D and Unity

Example Usage
-------------

- Python docs: https://cadop.github.io/dhart/Python%20Docs/build/html/index.html
- C++ and C Interface docs: https://cadop.github.io/dhart/C++/html/index.html
- C# docs: https://cadop.github.io/dhart/C%23%20Public%20Docs/html/index.html

Once the python package is installed, the basic setup for loading a model (e.g. obj), setting its rotation (if its not default z up), and creating a BVH (the accelerated structure of the mesh) is done by:

```python
from dhart.geometry import LoadOBJ, CommonRotations
from dhart.raytracer import (EmbreeBVH,Intersect,
                                        IntersectForPoint,
                                        IntersectOccluded)
import dhart

# Get model path
obj_path = dhart.get_sample_model('plane.obj')
# Load mesh
loaded_obj = LoadOBJ(obj_path, rotation=CommonRotations.Yup_to_Zup)
# Create BVH
bvh = EmbreeBVH(loaded_obj)
```

After this, different methods for casting a ray can be used:

```python
# Define point to start ray
p1 = (0, 0, 2)
# Define direction to cast ray
dir = (0, 0, -1)

# Cast a ray for the hitpoint
hit_point = IntersectForPoint(bvh, p1, dir, -1)
print(f"Hit point: {hit_point}")

# Cast a ray for distance/meshid
distance, mesh_id = Intersect(bvh, p1, dir, -1)
print(f"distance is {distance}, meshid is {mesh_id}")

# See if it occludes
does_occlude = IntersectOccluded(bvh, p1, (0, 0, -1), 9999)
print(f"Does the ray connect? {does_occlude}")
```

which would output

```
Hit point: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
distance is 2.0, meshid is 0
Does the ray connect? True
```

Getting started
===============


Installing
----------

- Requires Windows 10
- Tested on Python 3.8 +

For Python you can use

`pip install dhart`

In the latest release you can additionally use `pip install dhart[dev]` to install packages needed for visualization of examples and documentation. 

- However, if you would like to use Python with Rhino Grasshopper, you will need to follow the install instructions in the Python Docs. 

For C# you can download from the Releases page. 
- Of course, you can always clone this repo and build the project yourself. 

We supply `.dll`'s to try and make the installation and linking process as easy as possible. 


Building from Source
--------------------

You can use cmake on the commandline or Visual Studio, follow the instructions in `BUILD.md` to get started.
